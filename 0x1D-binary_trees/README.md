# Binary Trees

## What I learned from this project  
---   

**What is a binary tree?**  
*Each node has at most 2 children.
Strict binary tree has either 2 or 0 children.
Complete binary tree is all nodes are filled and as left as possible.
2^n and n is the levels. levels start at 0. we can have at max n number of nodes at lvl n.
Perfect binary tree is everything is filled.
Max number of nodes in a perfect binary is 2^(n+1) - 1.
Height is a Logbase2 n for complete binary and log base2 (n+1) for perfect binary tree.
A 2 to the 100th power will have a time of log base 2 100 which is just 100.
Height of tree is one less than the longest number of consec nodes.*  

*If height is minimized then cost of operations is lowered. Balance is good.
Implement binary trees using dynamically created nodes. Store addresses, linked via pointers. Or we can store the binary tree in an array.
Array only works for a complete binary tree. left child is 2i+1 and right child is 2i+2. I is the index or levels. Array that is a heap is like this.*



**What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?**  
*Binary tree is a linked data structure where each node can point to up to 2
kids and a BST or binary search tree if the key of the node is smaller than all
its right subtree and greater than all its left subtree.*  

**What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?**  
*Singly linked list has a O(n) access and search time complexity with a 0(1) for insertion and deletion. This is for average and worse case scenarios.*  

*But a BST has log(n) for access and search which is great but the tradeoff is the insertion and deletion is not O(1) like linked lists but also log(n). And worst case scanarios for BST is O(n) for accessing, searching, inserting, and deleting.*  


**What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree?**  
*The depth is the number of edges from the node to the root.
The height is the number of edges on the longest path. The size is the number of nodes on the tree. Edges are connections.*  


**What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?**  
*inorder, preorder, and postorder.
left root right, root left right, and left right root.*  


**What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree?**  
*A complete is every level is filled and complete and as left as possible. Also called almost complete and nearly complete binary tree.
A full tree is a tree where all nodes have 0 or 2 children. No singles allowed.
Perfect is perfect.
A balanced binary tree is balanced. Left and right subtrees differ in height by no more than 1. Basically the same height everywhere..*

### Extra Info



Binary tree is a data structure. Each node has at most 2 kids, left child andright child.
Popular for binary search trees and binary heaps. Effective for sorting andsearching.
Important terms: path, root, parent, child, leaf, subtree, visiting, traversing, levels, keys.
Root is at level 0. The child is level 1. Grandchild is lvl 2.
Binary search trees. Left child must be less than and right value must be greater.
Implement them by using node objects and connect them through references.

Here is an example.

	struct node {
		int data;   
		struct node *leftChild;
		struct node *rightChild;
	};

Basic methods of BST: insert, search, preorder traversal, inorder traversal, postorder traversal.

The first insertion creates the tree. After that, if an element is inserted it must locate the right location. 

Pseudocode:

	if root is NULL then create root node and return
	elif root exists then compare the data with node.data
		while until insertion point is located
			if data is greater than node.data then go to right subtree
			else go to left subtree
		end while
		insert data
	end if



That is the pseudocode for an insert. search is the same except inserting data,
just return the node.


Traversal is visiting all nodes of a tree and printing their values. No such
thing as random access in a tree. All nodes connected to links and edges.

3 traversals: in order, pre order, post order. Traversal to search or locate a
given item or key in a tree.


In-order traversal we visit the left subtree first then root then right subtree
in ascending order.

The generic algo is:

until all nodes are traversed

	1) recursion traverse left subtree
	2) visit root node
	3) recursion traverse right subtree
Pre-order traversal is we visit the root first then left subtree then right.
So it is like the previous algo but just swap step 1 and 2.
Post-order traversal is we visit root last so we shift the steps up. We recursion the left then the right then go to root.   
Binary tree is very useful as data storage.
It can be a ordered array or alinked list as searching is fast.
Insertion or deletion is as fast as a linked list.  
Binary search tree is BST. Also referred to as ordered or sorted binary tree.
They allow fast lookup, insertion and deletion, and can be used for dynamic sets of data or look up tables. They go from the root to leafs and they use a comparison of keys or data at each node and that determines if you go left orright.

Each comparison alows the operations to skip half of the tree. Logarithm of
the number of items. Slower than hash tables. Faster than arrays.

Search until they key is found or the remaining subtree is NULL.
Sort, priority queue operations,
